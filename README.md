# Kokomo
Kokomo is a competitor robot built for robocode that uses regression tree based learning (called "Dynamic Segmentation" by some in the Robocode community) to learn its opponent's movement strategy.

Like most top competitor robots, Kokomo collects GuessFactors - both its own and its opponents. Movement uses traditional Wave Surfing (an improvement over BasicGFSurfer). Targeting uses a custom regression tree.
